1 Supported UIs ________________________________________________________________

Although there are 4 UIs, only 2 currently support localization:
windows and gtk-glade.

To translate DeSmuME, see "Starting a new translation" below.

  1.1 gtk-glade UI _____________________________________________________________

  Localization is done with gettext. gettext uses po files.
  The po files are located in the po/ folder.
  Note that there is one po file per language.

  To use the available translations, set up your environment properly.
  e.g. under GNU/Linux you can verify that the value of your LANG variable.

  1.2 Windows UI ______________________________________________________________

  Localization is located in one single file: src/windows/resources.rc .


2 Starting a new translation ___________________________________________________

  2.1 gtk-glade UI _____________________________________________________________

  Grab a copy of po/desmume.pot and rename it.
  You can use the two letter iso code of the language as the filename
  e.g. fr.po
  or you can specify the country code as well
  e.g. fr_CA.po

  Open the newly created file with an editor: see "Editors" below.
  Translate the strings.
  Send us your translation by getting in touch with us: see "Contact Us" below.

  2.2 Windows UI _______________________________________________________________

  Grab a copy of src/windows/resources.rc .
  Create a section for your language by looking at another language e.g. french.
  Translate the strings.
  Send us your translation by getting in touch with us: see "Contact Us" below.


3 Editors ______________________________________________________________________

You can use plain text editors but there are many po file editors.
Here are some recommanded po editors, in no particular order.

  3.1 GNU/Linux ________________________________________________________________

  - gtranslator: http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net/
  - KBabel: http://kbabel.kde.org/

  3.2 OSX ______________________________________________________________________

  - LocFactory Editor:
    http://www.triplespin.com/en/products/locfactoryeditor.html

  3.3 All platforms ____________________________________________________________

  - poEdit: http://www.poedit.net/
  - OmegaT: http://www.omegat.org/omegat/omegat.html
  - GNUEmacs/XEmacs/AquaEmacs with po-mode
  - Vim with PO ftplugin
  - Eclipse with gted


4 Contact Us ___________________________________________________________________

As there isn't many translations so far, we're still asking you to get in touch
via the forum located at http://forums.desmume.org/ .

You can upload your translation files to your favorite sharing site and paste
the link in a post under General.


5 Creating translation friendly strings (gtk-glade) ____________________________

  5.1 In the code ______________________________________________________________

  Make sure libintl.h is included and that _() is defined.
  e.g. see src/gtk-glade/globals.h
  Add the filename to po/POTFILES.in if it's not already there.

  Where you would use "my text", use _("my text").
  For long strings, for translators' sanity, please do something like:

  printf( _(" This is a\n\
 very long text\n") );

  5.2 Glade interface __________________________________________________________

  You have nothing special to do aside from adding the filename to 
  po/POTFILES.in.


6 Updating the template (gtk-glade) ____________________________________________

To update po/desmume.pot, move to the po/ folder and execute "make update-po".


7 Integrating new translations

  7.1 gtk-glade UI _____________________________________________________________

  Add the new po file to po/ .
  Add the new language to ALL_LINGUAS in configure.ac .
  Regenerated the build files (./autogen.sh) and rebuild (./configure && make).
  You can also add the language to po/LINGUAS (it's a convention? it has no effect).

  7.2 Windows UI _______________________________________________________________

  Update the src/windows/resource.rc .
  Add the new language to to the list in src/windows/resource.h .
  Rebuild.
