1) System Requirements ________________________________________________________

DeSmuME is a very demanding app, especially for CPU usage. Before you begin,
make sure that your Mac meets the listed system requirements.

If your Mac meets only the minimum requirements, then you should expect to run
most simple 2D-only games with some frameskip, but you will be unable to run
complex 2D games or any 3D-heavy games. However, if your Mac meets the
recommended requirements, then you should expect to run almost every game,
including very complex 3D-heavy games, with minimal to no frameskip.

Operating System: OS X v10.5 (Leopard) or later

CPU:              Can run on any PowerPC G4, G5, or Intel processor
                  2.1 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (minimum)
                  3.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster (recommended)

RAM:              512 MB (minimum)
                  2 GB (recommended)


2) Quick Start Guide for Using DeSmuME for OS X _______________________________

Installing DeSmuME is as easy as copying DeSmuME.app to your Applications
folder (or other folder of your choice). Double-click the app to start DeSmuME.

Note that DeSmuME for OS X may have a different feature set than DeSmuME for
Windows and DeSmuME for Linux. As of this writing, some features that are
present in DeSmuME for Windows are not present in DeSmuME for OS X.

The rest of this section will be a guide to help you quickly get started using
DeSmuME for OS X.

Loading a ROM and Starting the Emulator:
Simply double-click the desired ROM from the Finder to play the game. By
default, DeSmuME will load the ROM and start emulation. Also, there are
additional ROM loading options that you can change in DeSmuME > Preferences if
you need them.

Using the DS Controller:
Each DS controller button can be mapped to a button of your choice on your
keyboard, gamepad, or joystick. You can view the mappings by clicking on Input
in DeSmuME > Preferences, and then clicking the Controller tab on the Input
page. To change a mapping, click on the DS control that you want to change,
then press the button on your input device to map it.

By default, the DS controller is mapped to the following keys on your keyboard:
    Up - Up Arrow
    Down - Down Arrow
    Left - Left Arrow
    Right - Right Arrow
    A Button - X
    B Button - Z
    X Button - S
    Y Button - A
    L Trigger - Q
    R Trigger - W
    Start - Return
    Select - Tab
    Lid - Delete (Backspace)
    Debug - \
    Microphone - `

Using the DS Touch Pad:
Touch pad input is emulated using the left mouse button. Simply click in the
touch pad area of the DS display window to use the DS touch pad.

Rotating the DS Display:
Some games require that the DS display be at a certain rotation in order to
look correct. Rotation options can be found by choosing
View > Display Rotation. You can also use the toolbar buttons Rotate Left and
Rotate Right to rotate the display by 90 degrees counterclockwise or clockwise,
respectively.

Freezing and Restoring the Emulation State:
Save states are a powerful feature that allows you to freeze the emulation
state and restore it later. However, note that save states are only a
temporary means of saving -- more permanent saves must be done using the
in-game save (or ROM save).

- To freeze the emulation state, choose File > Save State File.
- To restore the emulation state, choose File > Open State File.

You can also freeze/restore emulation states without having to manage the
Open/Save dialogs. There are ten available save state "slots" that you can
use to quickly freeze/restore the emulation state.

- To quick freeze the emulation state, choose File > Save State Slot > Slot #.
  The default hotkey for this is (Shift-#).
- To quick restore the emulation state, choose File > Load State Slot > Slot #.
  The default hotkey for this is (#).


3) Additional Documentation ___________________________________________________

4) Contact Information ________________________________________________________

Thank you for you interest in DeSmuME! If you want to tell us how useful
DeSmuME is in your life, your love (or hate) of certain NDS games, your passion
for NDS homebrew development, or anything else related to DeSmuME or NDS
emulation, then there are various ways for you to contact us!

However, keep in mind that there are a few of rules that you need to follow:
- Do not ask us to provide ROMs, BIOS files, or any other copyrighted stuff.
  We don't want to have to deal with any legal issues that could get us in
  trouble, or worse, completely shut down.
  
- When contacting us, please use the appropriate means to do it. For example,
  if you simply want to tell us how much you love or hate us, then use the
  comments on the official webpage. Another example: If you want to post on the
  forum, be sure to keep the topic focused on DeSmuME; questions that ask for
  things like us providing you the latest Pokemon cheats are not DeSmuME
  related, and we will instead refer you to a Pokemon cheaters forum. Finally,
  our developer chat channel is intended for furthering the development work of
  DeSmuME; questions about how to use DeSmuME should not come here, but instead
  go to the Support forum. In short, use the appropriate contact method. That's
  why the different methods exist!

* Official Website: http://desmume.org

Our official website has the latest news on DeSmuME releases, and also has a
lot of other useful information about DeSmuME. You can comment on different
posts telling us how you feel about DeSmuME. Is DeSmuME the best thing in your
life? Is it making you cry? Or is it a bunch of blah? Let us know here!

* Public Forum: http://forum.desmume.org

If you have a question about DeSmuME, then this is the place to ask it. But
before you ask it, be aware that your question may have already been
answered before, so try the following things first:

- Read the manual and the FAQ. A lot of questions people have are usually
  already answered in our documentation.
- Do a forum search about your question.

If you still need to ask a question, then be sure to provide us the following
information:

- DeSmuME app version
- Your operating system and OS version
- The name of the ROM (if a ROM is involved)
- The serial code of the ROM (if a ROM is involved)

The app version can be found by choosing DeSmuME > About DeSmuME in the DeSmuME
app. Alternatively, you can select the DeSmuME app in the Finder and choose
File > Get Info.

You can find your operating system and OS version by choosing About This Mac in
the Apple menu.

The ROM name and serial can be found by choosing File > ROM Info in the DeSmuME
application.

It is very important that you provide us with this information! If you don't,
then it will take much longer for us to respond to your question.

* Live Developer Chat Channel: irc://irc.freenode.net/desmume

We have a live developer chatline on Freenode IRC at #desmume. This channel
is meant for discussing the development of DeSmuME, and shows the real work
that goes on behind the scenes. If you are interested in doing any sort of
software programming, software testing, documentation, or graphics work, then
please join our chat channel! We would love for you to join us!

* Bug Reports: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=164579&atid=832291

If you believe that you have found a bug, you may submit a bug report by
choosing Help > Submit a Bug Report in the DeSmuME application, or by
following the above link. This will take you to our bug tracker on SourceForge.
Do note that you will need a SourceForge account in order to submit a bug
report.

Bug submissions are very welcome and encouraged. However, when you submit a bug
to us, you MUST provide the following information, or else your bug submission
may be rejected:

- DeSmuME app version
- Your operating system and OS version
- Your Mac model identifier
- The name of the running ROM when the bug was observed (or "None", if no ROM
  was running)
- The serial code of the running ROM when the bug was observed (or "None", if
  no ROM was running)
- A description of the exact behavior you observed
- A description of the behavior you expected

You can find your Mac model identifier in the System Profiler app. The app is
located in the Applications/Utilities folder.

When you write your description, make sure that they are as detailed as
possible. The better your descriptions are, the faster we can test and fix
bugs.

For example, if you observed a bug in the game Golden Sun: Dark Dawn, then the
bug report could look something like this:

    App Version: v0.9.8
    Operating System: OS X v10.6.8
    Mac Model Identifier: iMac 11,2
    ROM Name: GOLDENSUN_DD
    ROM Serial: NTR-BO5E-USA
    Observed Behavior: I tried to load a save state using the
    File > Load State > Slot 3 menu option, but the game froze. If I reset, I
    can get the game working again.
    Expected Behavior: The game should continue running from the point where I
    made the save state.

We will try to get your bug tested as soon as possible, but any fixes may take
longer, depending on the complexity of the bug. Also, some bugs may require us
to ask you for certain files, such as your ROM saves, save states, or console
logs. For the above example, we would probably ask you for your save states to
help us track down the bug.
