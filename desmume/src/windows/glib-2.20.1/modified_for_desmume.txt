This package was modified for desmume from the official glib-2.20.1 release because I wasnt sure how else to get it running.
search for //desmume: for differences

Additionally, the entire build process was altered, because we believe in things that build in one step and we hate dlls.
Hopefully we'll never have to upgrade this package.
