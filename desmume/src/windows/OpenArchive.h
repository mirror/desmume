// this function will figure that out and work correctly either way.
// it also does the work of bringing up a within-archive file selector dialog if necessary,
// which even allows navigating to a file within an archive that's within the archive.
// the output PhysicalName is the filename of an uncompressed file
// for you to load with fopen or whatever,
// unless the function fails (or is cancelled) in which case it will return false.
// example input Name:          "C:\games.zip"
// example output LogicalName:  "C:\games.zip|Sonic.nds"
// example output PhysicalName: "C:\Documents and Settings\User\Local Settings\Temp\DeSmuME\rom7A37.smd"
