1 Compiling instructions______________________________________

DeSmuME is written in C using the gtk+ and SDL libraries.
So you need a working C compiler, such as gcc and
the above libraries runtime and development packages:

  * http://www.gtk.org

  * http://www.libsdl.org/

Once these libraries are installed, you should be ready to
install DeSmuME.

DeSmuME provides another interface based on libglade, to use
it, you'll need glade:

  * http://glade.gnome.org/

Uncompress the DeSmuME. source archive, move to the newly
created directory, type "./configure", then "make",
it will generate two programs: "desmume" in the "src/gtk"
directory and "desmume-cli" in the "src/cli" directory.
If glade is installed on your system, you'll get a third
binary: "desmume-glade" in the "src/gtk-glade" directory.

You can even type "make install" to install those programs on
your system (in /usr/local/ by default), then uninstalling is
done by typing "make uninstall".
