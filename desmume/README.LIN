1 Compiling instructions______________________________________

DeSmuME is written in C using the gtk+ and SDL libraries.
So you need a working C compiler, such as gcc and
the above libraries runtime and development packages:

  * http://www.gtk.org

  * http://www.libsdl.org/

Once these libraries are installed, you should be ready to
install DeSmuME.

DeSmuME provides another interface based on libglade, to use
it, you'll need glade:

  * http://glade.gnome.org/

Uncompress the DeSmuME. source archive, move to the newly
created directory, type "./configure", then "make",
it will generate two programs: "desmume" in the "src/gtk"
directory and "desmume-cli" in the "src/cli" directory.
If glade is installed on your system, you'll get a third
binary: "desmume-glade" in the "src/gtk-glade" directory.

You can even type "make install" to install those programs on
your system (in /usr/local/ by default), then uninstalling is
done by typing "make uninstall".


2 How to use DeSmuME__________________________________________

2.1 Gtk+ version______________________________________________

Type "desmume" in a shell, a window should appear, then open
a rom file using the "open" button, next use the "run" button
to start emulation.

There are a number of options that can be passed on to desmume
from the command line:

USAGE: desmume [OPTIONS] [nds-file]
OPTIONS:
   --opengl-2d         Enables using OpenGL for screen rendering
    --soft-convert     Use software colour conversion during OpenGL
                       screen rendering. May produce better or worse
                       frame rates depending on hardware.

   --disable-3d        Disables the 3D emulation

   --disable-sound     Disables the sound emulation

   --help              Display this message


NOTE:
You may get improved performance by also passing the argument
--gdk-gl-force-indirect. This has been seen to improve things for
Nvidia based graphics cards under Linux.


2.2 CLI version_______________________________________________

Just type "desmume-cli path-to-a-rom" in a shell.
