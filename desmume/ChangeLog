0.8 -> ?
 General/Core:
 - Added "high-level" check for DMAs and Timer for minor (really minor) speed up [shash]
 - Changed instruction execution to 16 at a time blocks (tested and stable) [shash]
 - Really minor memory access speed up (mainly added for clarity) [shash]
 - Added transparency and fixed material alpha support and alpha testing on the 3D core [shash]
 - Changed how depth initial values are calculated (fixes SM64DS skybox) [shash] 
 - Added SSE2 version for some matrix routines [CrazyMax]
 - Some fixes in core (New SMB don't freeze now) [CrazyMax]
 - Some optimizations in code [CrazyMax]
 - Make matrix 4x4 multiply routines use W-coordinate. [zeromus]
 - Add many matrix and vector functions to matrix.c [zeromus]
 - Convert to c++!
 - Added gfx3d module which emulates the whole GE as part of the core emu. Moved the windows/cocoa OGLRender to the 
   emu core and replace ogl_collector. Now every platform shares the same 3d code. [zeromus]
 - Add in some crude interpolation in the SPU (conditionally compiled) so that I can bear to listen to it. [zeromus]
 - Change savestate code to support loosely bound chunks and more easily other parts of the emu (GE, GPU).
   The savestate format is changed, but from now on it is in principle more resilient (it will continue to break though) [zeromus]
 - Remove 16MB of WRAM at 0x01****** from arm9. Maped to unusued instead. What was this? [zeromus]
 - Change SPU to run two spus in parallel. SPU_core is the official one. SPU_user produces output.
   This lets us do inaccurate things with SPU_user which might sound better while being more accurate with SPU_core. [zeromus]
 - Add RTC implementations (not fully) [CrazyMax]
 Mac OS X port:
 - Fixed: Filenames and paths with unicode characters now work. [Jeff]
 - Fixed: Load state from file button works again. [Jeff]
 - Save State panel now pauses emulation while the file selection box is open. [Jeff]
 - Fixed: Frozen video output (and/or messed 3d emulation) after loading a state. [Jeff]
 - Added option to load the most recent file upon launching the program. [Jeff]
 - Added French translation (thanks to Pierre Rudloff). [Jeff]
 - Added basic key mapping configuration to application preferences (thanks to Julio GorgŽ). [Jeff]
 - Added keyboard shortcuts for Execute, Pause and Reset command (thanks to Julio GorgŽ). [Jeff]
 - Default key mappings are no longer case sensitive. [Jeff]
 - Added ability to limit speed. [Jeff]
 - Fixed: Video output should work on software-only 3D renderers. [Jeff]
 Windows port:
 - Removed the bug report link with a define, to avoid reports from betas/external builds [shash]
 - Added the version on window bar to recognize versions from screenshots [shash]
 - Changed graphics render core to DirectDraw (work faster) [CrazyMax]
 - Some fixes in 3D core OGL (fixed textures) [CrazyMax]
 - Added texture caching (speedup 3D core) [CrazyMax]
 - Fixes clear depth (ex. Castlevania now don't flipping) [NHerve]
 - Make GE matrix mult and load commands clear out unused rows and cols to identity correctly [zeromus]
 - carry w=1 from vertex() through pipeline (this will be necessary for software 3d rendering) [zeromus]
 - Track polycount better. still worthless: at the very least, it doesnt account for clipping and culling [zeromus]
 - Fix errors in matrix operations regarding projection mode and pos-vector mode [zeromus]
 - Fix error in command unpacking which caused some display lists to totally blow up [zeromus]
 - Render shadow volumes [zeromus]
 - Convert alpha and material values from [0,31], [0,7] etc ranges to opengl [0,maxint] ranges in a more precise way [zeromus]
 - Fix a race condition in NDS_3D_Reset and NDS_glInit [zeromus]
 - Add many of NHerve's improvements into OGLRender because I was trying to fix all the 3d issues. [zeromus]
 - Toon shading infrastructure and a demo implementation [zeromus]
 - Implement lighting model in software instead of using opengl; improves (potential?) compatibility [zeromus]
 - Defer rendering until after flush. This was a necessary architectural change, as it permits savestate
   for the display list, and allows us eventually to separate the GE emulation from the rendering [zeromus]
 - Fix the 2d/3d compositing well enough for NSMB to fix bugs, but it is still bad [zeromus]
 - Reorganize 3d code to defer rendering to vblank. eliminates tearing, and maybe some texturing artifacts.
   also possibly helps performance a bit by letting the hardware pipeline work some more before blocking for
   framebuffer read. [zeromus]
 - Tweak optimization flags and change entire source code to use fastcall [zeromus]
 - Add opengl state caching. This is of dubious performance assistance, but it is easy to take out so I am leaving it for now. [zeromus]
 - Add MMU->GPU signal for when vram mappings change, which allows it to assume textures are unchanged unless vram has changed [zeromus]
 - Added a bunch of crazy templates to the cpu and mmu which speed up a the emu little by optimizing variable accesses [zeromus]
 - Add an arm9 cpu load average calculator [zeromus]
 ? Fix a bug in texture transformation mode 1 [zeromus]
 - Fix the buggy auto frameskip logic which made the emu slow to a crawl. Now it runs fast! [zeromus]
 - Fix resizing, rotate & aspect ration of main window. Add save window position and parameters [CrazyMax]
 - Rewrite all debug tools (autoupdate work now) [CrazyMax]
 - Add AVI output [zeromus]
 - Remove multithreading from user interface after finding several synchronization issues [zeromus]
